# LGBT Network // Innsbruck

## Stack

- d3
- formkit
- tailwind
- leaflet (and [themes](https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/))
- a timeline lib ([vis-timeline](https://github.com/visjs/vis-timeline) and [its standalone build](https://visjs.github.io/vis-timeline/examples/timeline/standalone-build.html))
- airtable sync with secured scope, limited to 100 calls
- arquero 

## Todo

- ~~Install tailwind~~
- ~~Install formkit and theme~~
- ~~setup vercel/github~~
- ~~setup d3/api calls~~
- ~~set up header and menus~~
- ~~set up leaflet~~
- ~~set up airtable sync~~
- ~~set up map theme~~
- ~~find timeline lib~~
- ~~bypass airtable limit (100 records)~~

- build up map data with arqueos
- create a generic function to load all data from airtable

- viz 3 map meetings

- viz 1 sankey
- viz 2 timeline
- viz 4 map corresp
- viz 5 directed

## What I need

- the access (to get the content, text, pictures)

## Warning

- API calls limit to 100 are bypassed by recursive functions (up to 10)
- Direct link does not load the data (eg: map meetings)
